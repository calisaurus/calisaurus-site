  <div class="content"><p>Cali woke up with a jolt. A loud beeping noise was emanating from somewhere within her quarters. With her eyes still closed she tried finding the source of the sound with her hands. No such luck. Reluctantly she opened her eyes, blinking the grasps of sleep away. She rolled out of bed and stumbled over to her desk. Her datapad blinking in time with the beeps. Instantly, everything came back to her. Grabbing her datapad, she ran out of her quarters in a very Cali-like clumsy fashion.</p>

<p>Without even tying the boots of her laces properly, she jumped clambered into her Vigilant. The new, shiny ship that had just been contracted to her. In an almost elegant fashion, she activated the ship’s comms system, relaying to her corp mates that she was indeed present and ready to fight.</p>

<p>But was she ready to fight? She sighed. No, she wasn't. She never was. These days, Cali only got called up for fleets against the Drifters. Even to this day, she was reluctant to fire even a single round of ammo in their direction. For a long time now, she had felt an almost maternal instinct to protect the Drifters. When questioned about this in the past, she never had an adequate answer. It was a feeling so difficult to verbalise.</p>

<p>Her beliefs weren’t necessarily those rooted in rumours that maybe the Drifters were protecting capsuleers from an unknown force, that perhaps if capsuleers hadn’t shot first, then maybe the Drifters wouldn’t be the murderous force they were known as today. Yet still, there was something there. Maybe, just maybe they are on our side, Cali thought as she undocked.</p>

<p>Her unwavering defiance in shooting at the Drifters was the reason she was undocking right now; her role in this fleet was an important one and one that didn’t directly conflict with her morals towards the Drifters. Surely just holding the Drifters in place whilst her fleet mates shot them wasn’t anywhere near as bad as actually firing upon them, right?</p>

<p>She soaked in the beauty before her eyes; a wormhole. As though someone was reading her mind, a voice spoke up. “We’re doing Barbican today. Fleet, take hole. Take hole.”
